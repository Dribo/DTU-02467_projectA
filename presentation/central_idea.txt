The central idea of our project is to take a look at how Wikipedia articles are interlinked, specifically starting
from the Cold War, and then scraping all the articles that are linked to, from the article about the Cold War.
We want to discover in which ways the articles belong to communities, and how the language used in the articles differ,
depending on the specific subject. If we have time, we want to extend this to also look at the german Wikipedia,
in order to see if there is any bias in the way the events of the Cold War is portrayed in English compared to German.
